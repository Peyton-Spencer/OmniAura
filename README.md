# Source code OmniAura synths.
Musicians today want to create audiovisual experiences. Yet, creating audio and visuals are separate efforts in modern technology. Our project, the Omni Aura Synth, attempts to bridge this gap. Our users will be able to plug their MIDI keyboard directly into our custom synth, giving them access to our feature set. This feature set will include a rich sound, created by blending analog and digital synthesis, as well as an RGB LED light show that will dance to the notes you play.
